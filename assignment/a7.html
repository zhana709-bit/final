      <h2>Assignment 7 Autobiographical Game</h2>
      <p>
        This autobiographical game is based on something I experience every morning:
        waking up, feeding Eevee, and eventually playing with her. These moments are
        usually so familiar that I barely think about them, but when I had to break
        them down into scenes and gameplay mechanics, I ended up observing my daily
        routine much more closely. Turning something ordinary into an interactive
        experience felt special and surprisingly enjoyable.
