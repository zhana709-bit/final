      <h2>Assignment 3 Experimental Clock</h2>
      <p>
        My experimental clock is called the Eevee Clock. It uses the state of my cat Eevee to represent different times of day: when awake, Eevee’s eyes are open and she follows the mouse; when asleep, her eyes are closed and she avoids the mouse. At the same time, the yellow and blue background colors also mark the active and sleep periods. What is novel to me is that time is expressed through the behavior of my cat, which makes it more emotional and playful. This changes how I normally pay attention to time, because I focus more on Eevee’s state rather than just the numbers.
