        A leaf shape island surround by water. There are lots of fish and boat. It is always green.<br>
        When I received the description, what came to my mind was a small island in the center of the canvas. Based on my two weeks of p5.js practice, I decided to use a geometric, color-block painting style. Since I wanted to achieve depth in the background, I searched online and found a function that interpolates between two different colors, then modified it slightly to better fit a static composition. For the waves and the island, I applied transparency adjustments to add more layers to the scene. I also used ellipses, curves, and coordinate transformations to construct the visual elements.
