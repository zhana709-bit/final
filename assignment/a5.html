      <h2>Assignment 5 Optical Illusion</h2>

       When I came across Moiré Patterns on a website, I realized that this effect was perfect for creating a Vivienne Westwood style plaid pattern. So, after searching online for some color references I liked, I began my own experiment. During the process, figuring out how to control the line thickness so that it stayed consistent yet not rigid took me quite a long time. I even tried rotating the two layers to form an X-shaped cross pattern, but I wasn’t satisfied with the result, so I changed it back.
